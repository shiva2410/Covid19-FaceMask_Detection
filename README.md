Face Mask Detection using custom object detection method with FastnetRCNN model


## (To detect whether person is wearing mask or not)
There are many real life problems that are in need to be solved by developers and programmers using Object detection techniques. With the same viewpoint this article would follow all the steps and requirements for solving the real life problem and i.e. to check whether a person is wearing a mask or not.
Instead of training our own model from scratch, one can build on existing models and fine-tune them for your own purpose without requiring as much computing power.
So lets start,
## *Installation:
## *Gather and label images:
## * Generating training data:
## *Creating label map and configuration:
## *Training:
## *Export inference graph
