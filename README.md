# Covid19-FaceMask_Detection
Face Mask Detection using custom object detection method with FastnetRCNN model


## (To detect whether person is wearing mask or not)
There are many real life problems that are in need to be solved by developers and programmers using Object detection techniques. With the same viewpoint this article would follow all the steps and requirements for solving the real life problem and i.e. to check whether a person is wearing a mask or not.
Instead of training our own model from scratch, one can build on existing models and fine-tune them for your own purpose without requiring as much computing power.
So lets start,
## * Installation:
Installing all the requirements for Object detection
## * Gather and label images:
Collect the images you want to detect and label those by labelling tool.
## * Generating training data:
Convert the labelled image data to csv files and then generate train.record and test.record
## * Creating label map and configuration:
Do some coustomization according to the needs
## * Training:
In this step we will Start the model training and collecting checkpoints
## * Export inference graph
From checkpoints we will generate frozen inference graph from checkpoints

### The step by step guide of above steps is explained in detail in article at link
